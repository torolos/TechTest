The Task:

Create an in memory implementation of IRepository<T> 

Hints:
* The interfaces are designed to test technical aptitude, not to suggest a real-world scenario. Ensure your solution meets the requirements.
* It is best to develop the solution with a Test Driven approach. The unit test code is as important as the implementation. NUnit has been referenced in the setup, but feel free to use any other packages you feel comfortable with.
* We value SOLID principles. And keep it simple.
* The code should be self-explanatory. Documentation should not be required to understand the code.
